This chapter discusses in detail the uniform sampling as it relates to both lowpass and bandpass sampling. That is, uniform sampling as applied to quadrature baseband signaling as well as complex sampling at IF or RF is discussed. The chapter illustrates the AGC algorithm and also addresses the implication of the peak to average power ratio of a signal and its impact on the AGC. In the context of data conversion, it is imperative to the performance of the modem to control the long-term changes in the received signal strength, thus preserving the overall dynamic range. This must be done without introducing significant clipping if the signal becomes large or under-representation by the data converter if the signal becomes small. Either case would degrade the signal quality and would have adverse effects on the desired SNR. The automatic gain control algorithm discussed in this chapter, one of several ways of implementing gain control, serves to regulate the signal strength in order to preserve optimal performance."

abstract = "Publisher Summary
This chapter begins with the introduction of fundamental requirements of Nyquist data converters. Topics such as quantization, oversampling, and performance are discussed in great detail and various common architectures of Nyquist data converters are also addressed. Popular Nyquist converters such as the FLASH converter, the pipelined and sub-ranging converter, the folding converter, the integrating dual slope converter, and the successive approximation converter are studied. The continually growing intricacy of multistandard and multimode radios in terms of desired flexibility, varied number of services, frequency bands, and complex modulation schemes is pushing the limit of common wireless transceivers. The principal aim of SDR technology is to enable such varied designs to be implemented on a single radio. A key approach to realizing this goal is by enabling further processing of the waveform, such as filtering and signal conditioning, in the digital domain, which otherwise was done in the analog domain. This can be accomplished by moving the analog/digital boundary closer to the antenna. That is not to say that the analog will be any easier, but rather that some of its complex functionality will be moved to the digital domain. The essential technology that will enable such advancement in radio design will have to come first and foremost through innovations in data conversion. The specifications of the ADC and DAC vary widely for IF sampling architecture versus, say, super-heterodyne or direct conversion."

abstract = "Power electronic converters as the intermediate stage connect various loads to power sources. In many cases, the power source is directly from the utility grid, which is an AC sinusoidal voltage. However, in various applications (e.g., adjustable speed motor drives), the AC power should first be converted into DC power. This conversion is called rectification and this chapter models single-phase AC/DC converters from the simplest diode rectifiers to controllable AC/DC converters. Then, the control strategies will be discussed with a focus on improving the power quality at the AC side, e.g., using a single-phase power factor correction control. Additionally, this chapter overviews the phase-locked loop synchronization techniques for single-phase AC/DC conversion systems, which are also applicable to single-phase DC/AC inversion systems. Different cases are presented to exemplify the control design considerations of single-phase AC/DC rectifiers."
